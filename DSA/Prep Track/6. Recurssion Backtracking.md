### Function Executions

- **Statements are executed line-by-line**:
    - Functions execute sequentially, starting from the top and moving down, with control transferred to other functions when they are called.
- **Example Code**:

```python
def fun1():
    print("fun1")

def fun2():
    print("Before fun1")
    fun1()
    print("After fun1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Before fun2")
    fun2()
    print("After fun2")

```

---

### Output

- Before fun2
- Before fun1
- fun1
- After fun1
- After fun2

### Recursion Dry Run

- **Recursive Function Example**:

```python
def fun(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n)
    fun(n - 1)
    print(n)

```
```python

```

- **Another Recursive Function Example**:

```python
def fun(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    return 1 + fun(n // 2)

```
