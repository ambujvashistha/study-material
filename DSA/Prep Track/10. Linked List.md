### Linked Lists

### Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays

- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a predefined size and can grow or shrink dynamically without memory reallocation.
- **Efficient Insertions & Deletions:** Inserting or deleting an element in a linked list (given a pointer to the node) is **O(1)**, while in an array, it can take **O(n)** due to shifting elements.
- **No Wasted Memory:** Arrays may have unused allocated space or require resizing, but linked lists use only the memory needed for their elements.
- **No Contiguous Memory Requirement:** Arrays require a continuous memory block, which can be difficult to find for large arrays. Linked lists can utilize scattered memory locations efficiently.
- **Ease of Implementing Data Structures:** Data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables (with chaining) can be more easily implemented using linked lists than arrays.

### Types of Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Creating nodes manually
a = Node(10)
b = Node(20)
c = Node(30)

a.next = b
b.next = c

# Alternate way
head = Node(10)
head.next = Node(20)
head.next.next = Node(30)

```

### Circular Linked List

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Creating nodes manually
a = Node(10)
b = Node(20)
c = Node(30)

a.next = b
b.next = c
c.next = a  # Circular link

# Alternate way
head = Node(10)
head.next = Node(20)
head.next.next = Node(30)
head.next.next.next = head  # Circular link

```

### Doubly Linked List

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

# Creating nodes manually
a = Node(10)
b = Node(20)
c = Node(30)

a.next = b
b.prev = a
b.next = c
c.prev = b
```

### Conceptual Questions in Python

```python
def printList(head):
    curr = head
    while curr:
        print(curr.data, end=" -> ")
        curr = curr.next
        if curr == head:  # For circular linked list
            break
    print("None")

def insertBegin(head, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = head
    if hasattr(head, "prev"):  # Doubly linked list
        head.prev = new_node
    return new_node

def insertEnd(head, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not head:
        return new_node
    curr = head
    while curr.next and curr.next != head:
        curr = curr.next
    curr.next = new_node
    if hasattr(new_node, "prev"):  # Doubly linked list
        new_node.prev = curr
    if hasattr(head, "next") and curr.next == head:  # Circular
        new_node.next = head
    return head

def deleteBegin(head):
    if not head:
        return None
    head = head.next
    if hasattr(head, "prev"):
        head.prev = None
    return head

def deleteEnd(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return None
    curr = head
    while curr.next.next:
        curr = curr.next
    curr.next = None
    return head

def insertPos(head, pos, data):
    if pos == 0:
        return insertBegin(head, data)
    new_node = Node(data)
    curr = head
    for _ in range(pos - 1):
        if not curr.next:
            break
        curr = curr.next
    new_node.next = curr.next
    if hasattr(new_node, "prev"):
        new_node.prev = curr
        if curr.next:
            curr.next.prev = new_node
    curr.next = new_node
    return head
```
