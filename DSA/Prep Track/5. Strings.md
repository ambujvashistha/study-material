**Python String**

- `s1 = "hello"`
    - This creates a **string object** in Python. Strings in Python are **immutable**, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.
    - Unlike C or C++, Python automatically handles memory management and does not use a null terminator (`\0`).

**String Operations in Python**

- **Concatenation:**
    
    ```python
    s1 = "hello"
    s2 = "world"
    result = s1 + " " + s2   # "hello world"
    
    ```
    
    - The `+` operator joins two strings together.
- **Repetition:**
    
    ```python
    s = "ha"
    result = s * 3   # "hahaha"
    
    ```
    
- **Comparison Operators:**
    
    ```python
    "apple" < "banana"    # True (lexicographical comparison)
    "abc" == "ABC"        # False
    
    ```
    - Strings are compared **lexicographically**, similar to dictionary order.
- **Substring (Slicing):**
    
    ```python
    s = "hello"
    sub = s[1:4]   # "ell"
    
    ```
    
    - You can extract a substring using slicing syntax `s[start:end]`.
- **Find Substring:**
    
    ```python
    s = "hello world"
    index = s.find("world")   # 6
    
    ```
    
    - Returns the **index of the first occurrence** of the substring. Returns `1` if not found.
- **Other Useful Functions:**
    
    ```python
    s.upper()     # "HELLO WORLD"
    s.lower()     # "hello world"
    s.replace("world", "Python")   # "hello Python"
    len(s)        # 11
    
    ```
