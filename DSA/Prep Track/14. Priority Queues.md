## Basic Priority Queue Operations in Python

- `heappush(heap, x)` – Inserts element `x` into the heap
- `heappop(heap)` – Removes and returns the smallest element (top of the min heap)
- `heap[0]` – Returns the smallest element without removing it
- `len(heap)` – Returns the number of elements in the heap
- `not heap` – Checks whether the heap is empty

### How to Define a Custom Comparator in Python

By default, `heapq` in Python implements a **min heap**.

To change the behavior (e.g., create a **max heap** or apply **custom ordering**), we use transformations like negating values or tuples with custom keys.

---

### 1. Using Negation for a Max Heap

```python
import heapq

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, -5)
heapq.heappush(heap, -1)
heapq.heappush(heap, -9)

# Access max element (negate again)
print(-heap[0])

# Remove max element
print(-heapq.heappop(heap))

```

---

### 2. Using Tuples for Custom Sorting

You can make the heap prioritize based on the **first element of a tuple**.

```python
import heapq

# Each item is (priority, value)
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, (3, "C"))
heapq.heappush(heap, (1, "A"))
heapq.heappush(heap, (2, "B"))

# Pops element with smallest priority
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: (1, 'A')

```
---

### 3. Using a Custom Comparator with a Key Function

Python doesn’t support direct comparators,

so we customize by precomputing a tuple key.

```python
import heapq

data = [5, 1, 8, 3]

# Sort by square of number
heap = [(x * x, x) for x in data]
heapq.heapify(heap)

# Smallest square comes first
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # (1, 1)

```

---

### 4. Heap with External Criteria (e.g., Frequency Map)

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]
freq = Counter(nums)

# Create a heap based on frequency
heap = [(freq[num], num) for num in freq]
heapq.heapify(heap)

# Element with lowest frequency has highest priority
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # (1, 2)

```
