## Stuff that can be built on the NST Compute Cluster

1. Mini Cloud Platform - think AWS
    1. A cloud, not a UI, not a deploy tool.
    2. How do you:
    •	isolate users?
    •	enforce quotas?
    •	manage multi-tenancy?
    •	expose apps safely?
    •	handle failures?
    •	What does “platform” even mean?
2. Self-Service App Hosting Portal - think Vercel
    1. A frontend + API for humans.
    2. How do you:
    •	review deployments?
    •	roll back safely?
    •	audit changes?
3. Distributed Job Queue & Worker System
4. Fault-Tolerant Key-Value Store (like distributed Redis)
5. Distributed Configuration & Secrets System
6. Cluster-Wide Scheduler (K8s-like, but simpler)
7. Internal Developer Platform - like Salesforce/Odoo
8. Platform Observability Stack (Metrics + Logs + Traces)
9. CI/CD System
10. Event Streaming Platform (Kafka-lite)
11. Distributed File Storage System (S3-like)
12. Batch Processing Engine (MapReduce-like)
13. Real-Time Collaborative Editor (think google sheets)
14. Multiplayer Game Server
15. Network Chaos & Failure Simulation Tool
16. System Debugging & Recovery Simulator
